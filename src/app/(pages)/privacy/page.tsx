            Cancellation & Refund Policy
          </h1>
          <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-8">
            Last updated on Mar 5th 2025

          <p>
            M3labs believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has
            therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-8 mt-4 space-y-2">
            <li>
              Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made
              within 2-3 days of placing the order. However, the cancellation
              request may not be entertained if the orders have been
              communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the
              process of shipping them.
            </li>
            <li>
              M3labs does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items
              like flowers, eatables etc. However, refund/replacement can be
              made if the customer establishes that the quality of product
              delivered is not good.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case of receipt of damaged or defective items please report the
              same to our Customer Service team. The request will, however, be
              entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same
              at his own end. This should be reported within 2-3 days of receipt
              of the products.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case you feel that the product received is not as shown on the
              site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the notice
              of our customer service within 2-3 days of receiving the product.
              The Customer Service Team after looking into your complaint will
              take an appropriate decision.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty
              from manufacturers, please refer the issue to them.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case of any Refunds approved by M3labs, it'll take 3-4 days for
              the refund to be processed to the end customer.
